How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    -, + pinpoint the changes which helps locate errors more easily

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    saves time, energy, quickly lets you see your code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros - you have more control over when you want something saved, you won't have a version saved that you 
    didn't want, it won't get saved at illogical points
    cons - you may forget to save an important change, 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allows more control and is setup for development work, multiple files are dependent upon each other
    in development work

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git diff -u, shows the different changes between two files
    git log, shows all the commits made for a particular file or set of files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If you make a change that breaks something you can always go back to a previous working version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    keeping track of my personal projects
